# Cartesian-Line-Analysis-and-Equation-Solver

This program reads in two Cartesian coordinates representing two 

points on a line, then computes the line equation, slope direction, and

line segment length between the two points. If the points are the same,

an error is reported. If the input is bad, an error is reported.

On error, a usage message is presented.
